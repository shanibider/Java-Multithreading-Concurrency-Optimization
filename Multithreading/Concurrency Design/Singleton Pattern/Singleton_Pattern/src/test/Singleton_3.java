// 3. Lazy initialization: In this method, object is created only if it is needed.
// This may prevent resource wastage. 
// An implementation of getInstance() method is required which return the instance.
// There is a null check that if object is not created then create,
// otherwise return previously created. 
// To make sure that class cannot be instantiated in any other way,
// constructor is made final. As object is created with in a method,
// it ensures that object will not be created until and unless it is required. 
// Instance is kept private so that no one can access it directly.
// It can be used in a single threaded environment 
// because multiple threads can break singleton property 
// because they can access get instance method simultaneously and create multiple objects.

// Lazy initialization
public class Singleton_3 {
	// Private instance, so that it can be 
	// accessed by only by getInstance() method
	private static Singleton_3 instance;
	
	// Private CTOR.
	private Singleton_3() {	}
	
	// Method to return instance of class 
	public static Singleton_3 getInstance() {
		if(instance == null) {
			// if instance is null, initialize
			instance = new Singleton_3();
		}
		
		return instance;
	}
}

// Pros:
// 1. Object is created only if it is needed.
// 	  It may overcome resource overcome and wastage of CPU time.
// 2. Exception handling is also possible in method.

// Cons: 
// 1. Every time a condition of null has to be checked.
// 2. instance can’t be accessed directly.
// 3. In multithreaded environment, it may break singleton property.
