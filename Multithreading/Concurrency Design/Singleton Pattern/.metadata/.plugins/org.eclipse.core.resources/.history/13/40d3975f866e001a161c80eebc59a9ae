// 3. Lazy initialization: In this method, object is created only if it is needed.
// This may prevent resource wastage. 
// An implementation of getInstance() method is required which return the instance.
// There is a null check that if object is not created then create,
// otherwise return previously created. 
// To make sure that class cannot be instantiated in any other way,
// constructor is made final. As object is created with in a method,
// it ensures that object will not be created until and unless it is required. 
// Instance is kept private so that no one can access it directly.
// It can be used in a single threaded environment 
// because multiple threads can break singleton property 
// because they can access get instance method simultaneously and create multiple objects.
